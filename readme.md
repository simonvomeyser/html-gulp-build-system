# html-gulp-build-system

Small and simple build system I created for frontend/design work e.g. when you have to effectively transform a *designers vision* to HMTL or prefer to design in the browser.

Based on:
- pug (https://github.com/pugjs/pug) for html templating
- stylus (http://stylus-lang.com/) 
- browser sync (https://www.browsersync.io/) for live reloading
