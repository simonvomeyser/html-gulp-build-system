# html-gulp-build-system

Simple build system I created and use for frontend/design work e.g. when you have to effectively transform a *designers vision* to  HMTL or you prefer to design in the browser in general.

![Demo gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonvomeyser/html-gulp-build-system/master/demo.gif)

Based on:
- pug (https://github.com/pugjs/pug) for html templating
- stylus (http://stylus-lang.com/) as css preprocessor  
- browser sync (https://www.browsersync.io/) for live reloading

## Installation

Just run 

```
npm install
```

and after that just

```
gulp
```

## Options

To minifiy your files for production you simply can use the ```--production``` option via

```
gulp --production
```

## Roadmap

* Add function to clean up sample data (maybe different branch)
* pull in html5bolierplate
* set up better looking (though less funny and such less dodge) sample data with examples of usage
